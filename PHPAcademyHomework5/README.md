<h4>Task1</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Create x number (minimum 3) of classes that have viewAction() method that outputs class name
    </li>
    <li>
        in index.php in root of homework make a logic that randomly chooses one of those classes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a main App class (that is final) that based on random input (choosen class) given from index.php outputs their viewAction()
    </li>
    <li>
        Each class should have a namespace (some classes can even share a namespace if you like, but there has to be a couple of different namespaces).
    </li>
    <li>
        Put classes in directories how you feel it is right, but use multiple directories altogether.

</ol>

<h2>Extra points</h2>

        Use interfaces and abstract classes where you feel they should go.

    </li>
